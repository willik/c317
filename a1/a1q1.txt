# Synopsis: specifying the inverse arithmetic problem
#

Initial state:
  Let result be the evaluation of the expression:
    result = 0

Goal state:
  When result equals T, the target integer:
  result == T

Actions:
  Let L be the list of integers
  Let operand be the choice of integer from L

  If result == 0, the actions are:
    - addition of operand from L, +
    - subtraction of operand from L, -

  If result == 1 and operand == 1, the actions are:
    - addition of operand from L, +

  If result == 1 and operand == -1, the actions are:
    - subtraction of operand from L, -
    - multiplication by operand from L, *
    - integer division by operand from L, /

  If result == -1 and operand == 1, the actions are:
    - subtraction of operand from L, -
    - multiplication by operand from L, *
    - integer division by operand from L, /

  If result == -1 and operand == -1, the actions are:
    - addition of operand from L, +
    - multiplication by operand from L, *
    - integer division by operand from L, /

  If result > 1 or result < -1 and operand == 1 the actions are:
    - addition of operand from L, +
    - subtraction of operand from L, -

  If result > 1 or result < -1 and operand == -1 the actions are:
    - addition of operand from L, +
    - subtraction of operand from L, -
    - multiplication by operand from L, *
    - integer division by operand from L, /

  If result =/= 0 and operand =/= 1 or -1
    - addition of operand from L, +
    - subtraction of operand from L, -
    - multiplication by operand from L, *
    - integer division by operand from L, /

  Note: once an integer has been used in an expression, it can not be used
        again

Effect of action / Transition model:
  result is modified by performing the operation with the operand from L

Path cost:
  The quantity of operations performed to obtain the result, where each
  operation has a step cost of 1
